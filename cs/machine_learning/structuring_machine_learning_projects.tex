\subsection{Ttransfer Learning}
When transfer leanring makes sense:
\begin{itemize}
\item task A and B have the same input x
\item you have a lot more data for task A than task B
\item low level features from A could be helpful for learning B
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-task Learning}
When multi-task learning makes sense:
\begin{itemize}
\item traning on a set of tasks that could benefit from having shared lower-level features
\item usually: amount of data you have for each task is quite similar
\item can train a big enough neural network to do well on all the tasks(better performance than seperate NN for each task)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{End-to-End Learning}
Pros and cons of end-to-end deep learning
\begin{itemize}
\item pros:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item let the data speak
	\item less hand-designing of components needed
	\end{itemize}
\item cons:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item may need large amount of data
	\item excludes potentially useful hand-designed components
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
