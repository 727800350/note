Succinct is a data store that enables efficient queries directly on a compressed representation of the input data.
Succinct uses a compression technique that achieves compression close to that of gzip and yet allows random access into the input data.
In addition, Succinct natively supports a wide range of queries including count and search of arbitrary strings, range and wildcard queries.

What differentiates Succinct from previous data stores is that Succinct supports these queries without storing any secondary indexes, without requiring data scans and without decompressing the data.
\red{All the required information is embedded within the compressed representation and queries are executed directly on the compressed representation}.

As a base API, Succinct exposes a simple interface that supports above queries on flat files.
Applications that perform queries on semi-structured data can extend this API to build higher-level data representations.

On real-world and benchmark datasets, Succinct requires as much as an order of magnitude lower storage compared to state-of-the-art systems with similar functionality.
As a result, Succinct executes more queries in faster storage, leading to lower query latency than existing systems for a much larger range of input sizes.
