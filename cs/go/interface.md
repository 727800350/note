**duck typing**: When I see a bird that walks like a duck and swins like a duck and quacks like a duck, I call that bird a duck. â€“ James Whitcomb Riley

This freedom to substitute one type for another that satisfies the same interface is called substitutability, and is a hallmark of object-oriented programming.

An interface type specifies a set of methods that a concrete type must posses to be considered an instance of that interface.

Like an envelope that wraps and conceals the letter it holds, an interface wraps and conceals the concrete type and value that it holds.
Only the methods reveald by the interface type may be called, even if the concrete type has others.
```go
os.Stdout.Write([]byte("hello"))
os.Stdout.Close()

var w io.Writer
w = os.Stdout
w.Write([]byte("hello"))
w.Close()  // compile error: io.Writer lacks Close method
```

An interface value is constructed of two words of data;

- one word is used to point to a method table for the value's underlying type, that is the dynamic type
- and the other word is used to point to the actual data being held by that value, that is the dynamic value.

Copying an interface value makes a copy of the thing stored in the interface value.

- If the interface value holds a struct, copying the interface value makes a copy of the struct.
- If the interface value holds a pointer, copying the interface value makes a copy of the pointer, but not the data it points to.

Interface values may be compared using == and !=.
Two interface values are equal if both are nil or if their dynamic type are identical and their dynamic values are equal according to the usual behavior of == of that type.

# empty interface
The `interface{}` type, the empty interface, is the source of much confusion. The `interface{}` type is the interface that has no methods.
So all types satisfy the empty interface.
That means that if you write a function that takes an interface{} value as a parameter, you can supply that function with any value. So, this function:
```go
func DoSomething(v interface{}) {
  // ...
}
```
will accept any parameter.

## static type and dynamic type
```go
var foo interface{}  // foo is of static type interface{}

foo {
  value: nil
  type: nil
}

// foo is of dynamic type float64
foo = 3.14
foo {
  value: 3.14
  type: float64
}

// foo is of dynamic type *Person
foo = &Person{}
foo {
  value: 0x11face04
  type: *Person
}
```

## type assertion
A type assertion is an operation applied to an interface value.
```go
x.(T)
```
- x is an expression of an interface type
- T is a type, called the "asserted" type

Two possibilities

- If T is a concrete type, then the type assertion checks whether x's dynamic type is identical to T. If this check succeeds, the result is x's dynamic value, whose type is of course T.
- If T is an interface type, then the type assertion checks whether x's dynamic type satifies T. If this check succeeds, the result is still an interface value with the same type and value components, but T's methods are accessible.

if type assertion fails, then the operation panics. We could use a boolean to check whether it succeeds.

### type switch
```go
func Println(x interface{}) {
  switch x := x.(type) {
  case bool:
    fmt.Println(x)
  case int:
    fmt.Println(x)
  default:
    fmt.Println("unkown type")
  }
}
```
the clause `x.(type)` is only valid in type switch

Like a switch statement, a type switch implicitly creates a lexical block, so the declaration of the new variable called x does conflict with a variable x in an outer block.
Each case also implicitly creats a separate lexical block.

# Why doesn't type T satisfy the Equal interface?
Consider this simple interface to represent an object that can compare itself with another value:
```go
type Equaler interface {
  Equal(Equaler) bool
}
```
and this type, T:
```go
// does not satisfy Equaler
type T int
func (t T) Equal(u T) bool {
  return t == u
}
```
Unlike the analogous situation in some polymorphic type systems, T does not implement Equaler.
The argument type of T.Equal is T, not literally the required type Equaler.

In Go, the type system does not promote the argument of Equal; that is the programmer's responsibility, as illustrated by the type T2, which does implement Equaler:
```go
// satisfies Equaler
type T2 int
func (t T2) Equal(u Equaler) bool {
  return t == u.(T2)
}
```
Even this isn't like other type systems, though, because in Go any type that satisfies Equaler could be passed as the argument to T2.Equal, and at run time we must check that the argument is of type T2.
Some languages arrange to make that guarantee at compile time.

# Can I convert a []T to an []interface{}?
Not directly. It is disallowed by the language specification because the two types do not have the same representation in memory.
It is necessary to copy the elements individually to the destination slice. This example converts a slice of int to a slice of interface{}:
```go
t := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
s := make([]interface{}, len(t))
for i, v := range t {
  s[i] = v
}
```

# http.Handler interface
```go
package http

type Handler interface {
  ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)
}

func ListenAndServe(address string, h Handler) error

type HandlerFunc func(w ResponseWriter, r *Request)

func (f HandlerFunc) ServeHTTP(w ResponseWriter, r *Request) {
  f(w, r)
}
```
HandlerFunc demonstrates some unusual features of Go's interface mechanism.
It is a function type that has methods and satifies an interface, http.Handler.

For convenience, net/http provides a global ServeMux instance called DefaultServeMux and package-level functions called http.Handle and http.HandleFunc.
To use DefaultMux as the server's main handler, we needn't pass it to ListenAndServe; nil will do.

Finally, an important reminder, the web server invokes each handler in a new goroutinue.
