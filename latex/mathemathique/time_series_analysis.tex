\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Four important practical problems}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Forecasting Time series}\\
Forcasts are usually needed by a period known as the \textbf{lead time}(A lead time is the latency (delay)
between the initiation and execution of a process).

$\hat{z}_t(l)$ forecast function at origin $t$.\\
$\hat{z}_t(l)$ is the forecast of $z_{t+l}$

\textbf{Assumption}: The time series $z_t$ follows a stochastic model of a known form.

\item{Estimation of Transfer Functions}\\
eg: the dynamic relationship between between two time series $Y_t$ and $X)t$ can be determined, past values of \textbf{both series} may be used in
forecasting $Y_t$

\item {Analysis of Effects of Unusual Intervention Events to a System}\\
intervention events: indicator variable taking only 1 and 0 to indicate(quantitatively) the presence or absence of the event.

\item {Discrete Control Systems}\\
When we can measure fluctuations in an input variable that can be observed but not changed, it may be possible to make appropriate compensatory changes
in some other control variable. This is referred to as \textbf{feedforward control}.

Alternatively, we may be able to use the deviation from target or "error signal" of the output characteristic itself to calculate appropriate
compensatory changes in the control variable. This is called \textbf{feedback control}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Stochastic Mathematical Models}
\begin{description}
\item [backward shift operator $B$] $Bz_t = z_{t-1}$, hence $B^m z_t = z_{t-m}$
\item [forward shift operator $F$] $Fz_t = z_{t+1}$, $F = B^{-1}$
\item [backward difference operator $\nabla$] $\nabla z_t = z_t - z_{t-1} = (1-B)z_t$
\end{description}

\textbf{Linear filter model}\\
$$z_t = \mu + a_t + \psi_1 a_{t-1} + \psi_2 a_{t-2} + \cdots = \mu + \psi(B) a_t$$
$\mu$: level of the process, and
$$\psi(B) = 1 + \psi_1 B + \psi_2 B^2 + \cdots$$
