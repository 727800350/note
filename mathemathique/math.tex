\section{Error measure}
MAPE(Mean absolute percentage error)
$$ MAPE = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \dfrac{\norm{\estimate{y}_i - y_i}}{y_i} \cdot 100\%$$

MSE(Mean square error)
$$MSE = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\estimate{y}_i - y_i)^2$$

RMSE(Root mean square error)
$$RMSE  = \sqrt{MSE}$$

CE(Cummulative Error)
$$CE = \sum_{i=1}^n (\estimate{y}_i - y_i)$$

ACE(Absolute Cummulative Error)
$$ACE = \sum_{i=1}^n \norm{\estimate{y}_i - y_i}$$

VAF(Variance Accounting For)
$$VAF = (1 - \dfrac{\var(y - \estimate{y})}{\var(y)})$$

\section{Test}
\subsection{Linearity}
NACF(The normalized autocorrelation function)

The NACF is a measure of linear dependence between the random variates of the time series and can suggest a choice of linear predictive models 
such as autoregressive and/or moving average (ARMA) models that can capture the observed correlation function.\\
These models generally require that the model errors be Gaussian distributed. 
Therefore tests of linearity and normality of the data will have to be confirmed before such models are hypothesized.
